### Summary of Chapter 2: Standardization  
### Key Focus:  
1. **WG21 Structure**:  
   - C++ standardization is managed by Working Group 21 (WG21).  
   - Divided into three stages:  
     - **Stage 3**: Finalizes wording (Core Language Working Group, CWG; Library Working Group, LWG).  
     - **Stage 2**: Evolves language/library features (EWG for core language, LEWG for libraries).  
     - **Stage 1**: Domain-specific research via Study Groups (SGs).  
   - Study Groups (e.g., SG1 for concurrency, SG6 for numerics) incubate proposals before formal review.  

2. **Challenges**:  
   - Understanding the roles of Study Groups (e.g., SG15 for tooling, SG16 for Unicode).  
   - Distinguishing between stages (e.g., Stage 1 vs. Stage 2 responsibilities).  
   - Recognizing the impact of domain-specific SGs (e.g., SG21 for Contracts, SG22 for C/C++ liaison).

### **Answers & Explanations**  

1. **B, D**  
   - Stage 3 finalizes wording (B) and ensures documentation consistency (D). Stage 1 handles domain proposals (A), and Stage 2 approves library evolution (C).  

2. **A**  
   - SG1 handles concurrency. SG7 (compile-time), SG14 (low-latency), and SG21 (Contracts) are unrelated.  

3. **C, D**  
   - Stage 1 uses Study Groups (C), while Stage 2 approves evolution (D). Stage 3 handles wording (A), and Stage 2 does not focus on incubation (B).  

4. **A, B**  
   - SG15 (tooling) and SG16 (Unicode). SG18 (LEWG incubator) and SG20 (education) are unrelated.  

5. **A**  
   - LEWG is part of Stage 2, which handles library evolution.  

6. **D**  
   - SG19 focuses on machine learning, not quantum computing. SG3, SG9, and SG12 are valid.  

7. **A**  
   - SG22 coordinates C/C++ standards. Contracts (B) are SG21, networking (C) is SG4, and low-latency (D) is SG14.  

8. **B**  
   - EWG/LEWG are Stage 2 groups. Stage 1 uses SGs, and Stage 3 uses CWG/LWG.  

9. **B**  
   - SG7 focuses on compile-time programming. SG6 (numerics), SG8 (Concepts), and SG9 (Ranges) are unrelated.  

10. **C**  
   - Stage 3 produces the finalized standard draft. Proposals (A) and specifications (B) are Stage 2 outputs; research (D) is Stage 1.
