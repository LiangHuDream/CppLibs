### Step-by-Step Guide to Chapter 4: Processor Architecture (Y86-64)

---

### 1. Y86-64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
Key Concepts:
- **Y86-64** is a simplified 64-bit instruction set derived from x86-64.
- Registers: 15 general-purpose registers (`%rax`, `%rcx`, etc.) and `%rsp` (stack pointer).
- Instruction encoding: 1–10 bytes per instruction, including opcode, register specifiers, and immediates.
- **Status codes**: `AOK` (normal), `HLT` (halt), `ADR` (invalid address), `INS` (invalid instruction).

Example Code (Y86-64 Assembly):
```y86
# Example Y86-64 program: Sum an array
.pos 0
    irmovq stack, %rsp   # Initialize stack pointer
    call main            # Call main function
    halt

main:
    irmovq array, %rdi   # Address of array
    irmovq 3, %rsi       # Length of array
    call sum             # Call sum function
    ret

sum:
    xorq %rax, %rax      # Initialize sum to 0
loop:
    andq %rsi, %rsi      # Check loop counter
    jle done
    addq (%rdi), %rax    # Add current element to sum
    irmovq 8, %rdx       # Offset for next element
    addq %rdx, %rdi      # Move to next element
    irmovq 1, %rdx
    subq %rdx, %rsi      # Decrement counter
    jmp loop
done:
    ret

# Data section
array:
    .quad 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
stack:
```

### 2. Logic Design & Hardware Control Language (HCL)
Key Concepts:
- **Combinational circuits** (e.g., ALU, condition codes) and **sequential circuits** (e.g., registers, memory).
- **HCL**: A hardware description language to model logic gates and processor behavior.
- **Register file**: Read/write operations based on register IDs.
- **Memory**: Read/write operations with address validation.

Example HCL Code (Condition Code Calculation):
```hcl
# HCL code to compute ZF (Zero Flag)
word alu_output = [
    icode == IOPQ : aluA OP aluB;
    # Other cases...
];

bool ZF = (alu_output == 0);
```

---

### 3. Sequential Y86-64 Implementation (SEQ)
Key Concepts:
- **SEQ** (Sequential Processor): Executes one instruction per clock cycle.
- **Stages**: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write-Back, PC Update.
- **PC Computation**: Next PC is determined by the current instruction (e.g., `jmp`, `call`).

Example C Code (Simulating SEQ Stages):
```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int pc;
    int registers[16];
    unsigned char memory[4096];
} CPU;

void fetch(CPU *cpu) {
    // Simplified fetch stage: Read opcode from memory
    unsigned char opcode = cpu->memory[cpu->pc];
    printf("Fetch: Opcode = 0x%02X at PC = 0x%04X\n", opcode, cpu->pc);
    cpu->pc++;
}

int main() {
    CPU cpu = {0};
    cpu.memory[0] = 0x30;  // Example: irmovq instruction

    fetch(&cpu);
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Fetch: Opcode = 0x30 at PC = 0x0000
```

### 4. Pipelined Y86-64 Implementation (PIPE)
Key Concepts:
- **Pipelining**: Overlaps execution of multiple instructions.
- **Pipeline registers** (F, D, E, M, W) hold intermediate state.
- **Hazards**:
  - **Data hazards**: Solved via forwarding/stalling.
  - **Control hazards**: Solved via branch prediction.

Example Code (Pipeline Hazard Detection):
```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int srcA, srcB;
    int dstE, dstM;
    int valA, valB;
} PipelineRegister;

void detect_hazards(PipelineRegister *d, PipelineRegister *e) {
    if (d->srcA == e->dstE || d->srcA == e->dstM ||
        d->srcB == e->dstE || d->srcB == e->dstM) {
        printf("Data hazard detected!\n");
    }
}

int main() {
    PipelineRegister D = {.srcA = 1, .srcB = 2};
    PipelineRegister E = {.dstE = 1, .dstM = 3};
    detect_hazards(&D, &E);  // Hazard: D.srcA matches E.dstE
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Data hazard detected!
```

---

### 5. Advanced Topics: Forwarding & Stalling
Key Concepts:
- **Forwarding**: Bypass pipeline registers to resolve data dependencies.
- **Stalling**: Insert bubbles to delay instruction execution.

Example Code (Forwarding Logic):
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int alu_result = 100;  // Value computed in Execute stage
    int forward_val = alu_result;

    printf("Forwarded value: %d\n", forward_val);  // Simulate forwarding
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Forwarded value: 100
```

---

### 6. Testing the Complete Pipeline
Example Code (Full Pipeline Simulation):
```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int pc;
    int stage;  // F=0, D=1, E=2, M=3, W=4
} PipelineStage;

void advance_pipeline(PipelineStage *p) {
    p->stage = (p->stage + 1) % 5;
    printf("Stage advanced to %d. PC = 0x%04X\n", p->stage, p->pc);
}

int main() {
    PipelineStage pipe = {.pc = 0x100, .stage = 0};
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        advance_pipeline(&pipe);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Stage advanced to 1. PC = 0x0100
Stage advanced to 2. PC = 0x0100
Stage advanced to 3. PC = 0x0100
Stage advanced to 4. PC = 0x0100
Stage advanced to 0. PC = 0x0100
```

### Answers and Explanations

---

**Question 1: Pipeline Stages in Y86-64**  
**Correct Answers**: A, B, C, D, E  
- **Explanation**: The Y86-64 pipeline includes Fetch (A), Decode (B), Execute (C), Memory (D), and Write-Back (E). "Commit" (F) is not part of the Y86-64 pipeline; it is a stage in more complex architectures like out-of-order processors.  

---

**Question 2: Data Hazards**  
**Correct Answers**: A, C  
- **Explanation**: Data hazards (e.g., RAW) are resolved by **forwarding** (C) to bypass stale results and **stalling** (A) if forwarding is insufficient. Branch prediction (B) handles control hazards, and reordering (D) is done by compilers/out-of-order engines, not the pipeline itself.  

---

**Question 3: Control Logic and HCL**  
**Correct Answers**: A, C  
- **Explanation**: HCL describes **combinational logic** (not sequential) using `mux` (C). HCL equations evaluate to integers, not Booleans (B is false). While HCL can guide Verilog (D), it does not directly synthesize it. Sequential logic (A) uses registers with clock triggers.  

---

**Question 4: Exception Handling**  
**Correct Answers**: A, D  
- **Explanation**: Y86-64 exceptions occur for invalid opcodes (A) and `ret` with an empty stack (D). Unaligned memory access (B) and arithmetic overflow (C) are not exceptions in Y86-64.  

---

**Question 5: Forwarding Paths**  
**Correct Answers**: A, B  
- **Explanation**: Forwarding from Memory (A) or Write-Back (B) stages to earlier stages resolves RAW hazards. Forwarding from Fetch (D) is invalid, and Execute-to-Decode (C) is not a standard path.  

---

**Question 6: Branch Misprediction Penalty**  
**Correct Answers**: B, C  
- **Explanation**: On misprediction, the pipeline flushes incorrect instructions (B), and the branch predictor updates its buffer (C). Instructions after the branch are not necessarily squashed (A), and in-order execution (D) is unrelated.  

---

**Question 7: HCL and Combinational Logic**  
**Correct Answers**: A, C, D  
- **Explanation**: Combinational logic includes Boolean expressions (A), case expressions (C), and signal assignments (D). `reg = in` (B) represents sequential logic.  

---

**Question 8: Pipeline Registers**  
**Correct Answers**: A, B  
- **Explanation**: Pipeline registers store stage outputs (A) and synchronize flow (B). Structural hazards (C) are resolved by resource duplication, not registers. Speculative execution (D) is unrelated.  

---

**Question 9: Performance Metrics**  
**Correct Answers**: B, D  
- **Explanation**: CPI increases with stalls (D) and mispredictions (B). Pipeline stages (A) affect latency, and clock frequency (C) affects cycle time, not CPI.  

---

**Question 10: Multi-Cycle Instructions**  
**Correct Answers**: B, D  
- **Explanation**: `MULQ` (B) and `PUSHQ` (D) may take multiple cycles (e.g., memory access). `ADDQ` (A) and `JMP` (C) are single-cycle in Y86-64.
