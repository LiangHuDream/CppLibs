### Chapter 2: "A Tale of Two Values"

#### **Key Concepts**:
1. **Two Values of Software**:
   - **Behavior**: The functionality a system provides to meet immediate user needs (e.g., features, bug fixes).
   - **Architecture**: The structural design enabling long-term flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.
   - **Conflict**: Prioritizing behavior (urgent) over architecture (important) leads to technical debt and high maintenance costs.

2. **Eisenhower Matrix**:
   - Behavior = **Urgent but Not Important** (quadrant 3).
   - Architecture = **Important but Not Urgent** (quadrant 2).
   - Ignoring architecture leads to systems that are hard to modify.

3. **Architectural Significance**:
   - A clean architecture minimizes the cost of change over time. Poor architecture makes even simple changes risky and expensive.

### **Code Examples**:
We’ll use two versions of a payroll system to demonstrate the impact of architecture on flexibility.

---

#### **Example 1: Poor Architecture (Tight Coupling)**
```java
// Violates Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
// Behavior prioritized over architecture. Hard to change payment processors.

class PaymentProcessor {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        // Direct dependency on PayPal API (volatile detail)
        PayPalAPI api = new PayPalAPI();
        api.sendPayment(amount);
        System.out.println("Payment processed via PayPal: $" + amount);
    }
}

class PayPalAPI {
    public void sendPayment(double amount) {
        // Simulate API call
        System.out.println("[PayPal] Sending payment: $" + amount);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentProcessor processor = new PaymentProcessor();
        processor.processPayment(100.0);
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
[PayPal] Sending payment: $100.0
Payment processed via PayPal: $100.0
```

**Problem**:  
- `PaymentProcessor` is tightly coupled to `PayPalAPI`. Switching to Stripe requires rewriting the class.
- No abstraction between high-level policy (payment processing) and low-level details (PayPal API).

---

#### **Example 2: Clean Architecture (Dependency Inversion)**
```java
// Follows DIP: High-level modules depend on abstractions.
// Easy to swap payment processors without changing core logic.

interface PaymentGateway {
    void sendPayment(double amount);
}

class PayPalGateway implements PaymentGateway {
    @Override
    public void sendPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("[PayPal] Sending payment: $" + amount);
    }
}

class StripeGateway implements PaymentGateway {
    @Override
    public void sendPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("[Stripe] Charging card: $" + amount);
    }
}

class PaymentProcessor {
    private PaymentGateway gateway;

    // Dependency injected through constructor (Inversion of Control)
    public PaymentProcessor(PaymentGateway gateway) {
        this.gateway = gateway;
    }

    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        gateway.sendPayment(amount);
        System.out.println("Payment processed: $" + amount);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentGateway paypal = new PayPalGateway();
        PaymentProcessor processor1 = new PaymentProcessor(paypal);
        processor1.processPayment(100.0);

        PaymentGateway stripe = new StripeGateway();
        PaymentProcessor processor2 = new PaymentProcessor(stripe);
        processor2.processPayment(200.0);
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
[PayPal] Sending payment: $100.0
Payment processed: $100.0
[Stripe] Charging card: $200.0
Payment processed: $200.0
```

**Advantages**:  
- **Decoupled Components**: `PaymentProcessor` depends on the `PaymentGateway` abstraction, not concrete APIs.
- **Easy Extension**: Add new payment processors (e.g., Stripe) without modifying existing code.
- **Testable**: Mock `PaymentGateway` for unit testing.

---

### **Testing the Examples**:
Both examples include `main` functions to validate behavior:
- **Example 1** works but is fragile to change.
- **Example 2** demonstrates architectural flexibility by supporting multiple payment gateways.

**Compilation & Execution**:
1. Save each example in separate files (`Main.java`).
2. Compile: `javac Main.java`
3. Run: `java Main`

---

### **Key Takeaways**:
- **Architecture > Short-Term Behavior**: Investing in abstractions (e.g., `PaymentGateway`) reduces long-term costs.
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules (business logic) should not depend on low-level details (APIs, databases).
- **Eisenhower Matrix**: Fight for architectural integrity even when pressured to prioritize urgent features.

### **Code Example: Dependency Inversion**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

// Abstraction
class Logger {
public:
    virtual void log(const std::string& message) = 0;
    virtual ~Logger() = default;
};

// High-level module depends on abstraction
class PaymentProcessor {
private:
    std::shared_ptr<Logger> logger;
public:
    PaymentProcessor(std::shared_ptr<Logger> logger) : logger(logger) {}
    void processPayment() {
        logger->log("Payment processed.");
    }
};

// Concrete implementation
class FileLogger : public Logger {
public:
    void log(const std::string& message) override {
        std::cout << "Log to file: " << message << std::endl;
    }
};

// Another implementation
class ConsoleLogger : public Logger {
public:
    void log(const std::string& message) override {
        std::cout << "Log to console: " << message << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    auto fileLogger = std::make_shared<FileLogger>();
    PaymentProcessor processor1(fileLogger);
    processor1.processPayment(); // Logs to file

    auto consoleLogger = std::make_shared<ConsoleLogger>();
    PaymentProcessor processor2(consoleLogger);
    processor2.processPayment(); // Logs to console

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:  
```
Log to file: Payment processed.
Log to console: Payment processed.
```

**Explanation**:  
- The `PaymentProcessor` depends on the `Logger` abstraction (DIP).  
- Concrete loggers (`FileLogger`, `ConsoleLogger`) implement the interface, allowing easy swapping without modifying high-level code.
