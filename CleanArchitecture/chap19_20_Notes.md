### Chapter 19: Policy and Level

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Policy (Business Rules):**  
   - Policies define the core logic/behavior of the system.  
   - High-level policies (e.g., business rules) should not depend on low-level details (e.g., databases, UI).  
   - Example: A payment processing policy should not depend on a specific payment gateway.  

2. **Level:**  
   - Indicates how "close" a component is to inputs/outputs or core logic.  
   - Higher-level components (closer to core logic) should depend on abstractions, not lower-level components.  
   - Example: A business rule (high-level) depends on an interface for data access, not a specific database (low-level).  

#### Code Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// High-level policy (Level 1)
class OrderProcessor {
public:
    virtual double calculateTotal(const std::vector<double>& prices) const {
        double total = 0.0;
        for (const auto& price : prices) {
            total += price;
        }
        return total;
    }
};

// Lower-level component (Level 2)
class Database {
public:
    std::vector<double> getOrderPrices(int orderId) {
        // Simulate database access
        return {10.5, 20.3, 5.2};
    }
};

// Adapter to invert dependency
class OrderService {
private:
    OrderProcessor& processor;
    Database& db;
public:
    OrderService(OrderProcessor& proc, Database& database) 
        : processor(proc), db(database) {}
    
    double processOrder(int orderId) {
        auto prices = db.getOrderPrices(orderId);
        return processor.calculateTotal(prices);
    }
};

// Test
int main() {
    Database db;
    OrderProcessor processor;
    OrderService service(processor, db);
    double total = service.processOrder(123);
    std::cout << "Total: $" << total << std::endl; // Output: Total: $36.0
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Policy:** `OrderProcessor` handles business logic (calculating totals).  
- **Level Separation:** `OrderService` acts as an adapter to decouple `OrderProcessor` from `Database`.  
- **Dependency Inversion:** High-level `OrderProcessor` does not depend on low-level `Database`.

### Chapter 20: Business Rules

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Entities:**  
   - Represent core domain objects (e.g., `User`, `Order`).  
   - Contain business logic that is independent of external systems.  

2. **Use Cases:**  
   - Coordinate data flow between entities and external systems (e.g., databases).  
   - Example: A `CreateOrderUseCase` might validate data and save an `Order` entity.  

#### Code Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

// Entity (Business Rule)
class Order {
private:
    std::string orderId;
    std::vector<double> items;
public:
    Order(const std::string& id, const std::vector<double>& items)
        : orderId(id), items(items) {}
    
    double calculateTotal() const {
        double total = 0.0;
        for (const auto& item : items) {
            total += item;
        }
        return total;
    }
};

// Use Case
class CreateOrderUseCase {
public:
    Order execute(const std::string& orderId, const std::vector<double>& items) {
        if (items.empty()) {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Order must have items.");
        }
        return Order(orderId, items);
    }
};

// Test
int main() {
    CreateOrderUseCase useCase;
    Order order = useCase.execute("ORD123", {15.0, 25.5, 10.0});
    std::cout << "Order Total: $" << order.calculateTotal() << std::endl; // Output: Order Total: $50.5
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Entity:** `Order` encapsulates the business rule for calculating totals.  
- **Use Case:** `CreateOrderUseCase` validates input and creates an `Order`.  
- **Decoupling:** Business rules in `Order` are independent of databases/UI.

### Compilation & Testing:
1. **Compile with GCC:**  
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++11 policy_level.cpp -o policy_level
   g++ -std=c++11 business_rules.cpp -o business_rules
   ```

2. **Run Tests:**  
   ```bash
   ./policy_level       # Output: Total: $36.0
   ./business_rules     # Output: Order Total: $50.5
   ```

### Summary:
- **Chapter 19:** High-level policies must depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete low-level details.  
- **Chapter 20:** Entities encapsulate business rules; use cases orchestrate interactions while keeping core logic decoupled.  
- **Code Design:** Dependency inversion and separation of concerns ensure flexibility and testability.
- ### Summary of Chapters 19 & 20  
**Chapter 19: Policy and Level**  
- Focuses on organizing system architecture by separating policies based on their level of abstraction.  
- **Key Concepts**:  
  1. **Policy**: A set of rules/processes that dictate system behavior.  
  2. **Level**: The distance of a policy from inputs/outputs (higher levels are more abstract, lower levels are implementation details).  
  3. **Stable Abstraction Principle**: High-level policies should not depend on low-level details.  
  4. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules define interfaces; low-level modules implement them.  

**Chapter 20: Business Rules**  
- Explores structuring business rules as independent entities decoupled from frameworks/databases.  
- **Key Concepts**:  
  1. **Entities**: Encapsulate critical business rules/data structures (e.g., `Order`, `User`).  
  2. **Use Cases**: Orchestrate application-specific workflows (e.g., `PlaceOrderUseCase`).  
  3. **Interface Segregation**: Use narrow interfaces to avoid unnecessary dependencies.  
  4. **Boundaries**: Separate business logic from I/O mechanisms (e.g., databases, UIs).

### Test Code Examples (C++)  

**Entity Example (Chapter 20)**  
```cpp 
// Entity: Business rule for validating orders. 
class Order { 
private: 
  double amount; 
  std::string currency; 
public: 
  Order(double amt, std::string curr) : amount(amt), currency(curr) {} 
  bool isValid() const { 
    return amount > 0 && (currency == "USD" || currency == "EUR"); 
  } 
}; 

// Test 
int main() { 
  Order validOrder(100.0, "USD"); 
  Order invalidOrder(-50.0, "JPY"); 
  assert(validOrder.isValid()); 
  assert(!invalidOrder.isValid()); 
  return 0; 
} 
```  

**Use Case with Dependency Injection (Chapters 19-20)**  
```cpp 
// High-level interface 
class IRepository { 
public: 
  virtual void saveOrder(const Order& order) = 0; 
}; 

// Use Case: Coordinates workflow 
class PlaceOrderUseCase { 
private: 
  IRepository* repo; 
public: 
  PlaceOrderUseCase(IRepository* repo) : repo(repo) {} 
  void execute(const Order& order) { 
    if (order.isValid()) repo->saveOrder(order); 
  } 
}; 

// Mock implementation for testing 
class MockRepo : public IRepository { 
public: 
  void saveOrder(const Order& order) override { /*...*/ } 
}; 

// Test 
int main() { 
  MockRepo repo; 
  PlaceOrderUseCase useCase(&repo); 
  Order validOrder(200.0, "EUR"); 
  useCase.execute(validOrder); // Should save 
  return 0; 
} 
```  

These examples demonstrate:  
1. **Entities** encapsulate validation logic without external dependencies.  
2. **Use Cases** depend on abstractions (`IRepository`) and are testable with mocks.  
3. Adherence to DIP and ISP through interface segregation.
