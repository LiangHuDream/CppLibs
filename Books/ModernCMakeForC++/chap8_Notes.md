### Chapter 8: Linking Executables and Libraries - Key Concepts and Code Walkthrough

#### 1. **Basics of Linking**
**Key Points:**
- Linking combines object files and libraries into executable binaries
- Two main stages: symbol resolution (matching declarations/definitions) and relocation (memory address assignment)
- Static vs dynamic linking differences:
  - Static linking embeds dependencies at compile time
  - Dynamic linking resolves dependencies at runtime

**CMake Code Example:**
```cmake
# Static library
add_library(MyStaticLib STATIC src/mylib.cpp)
target_include_directories(MyStaticLib PUBLIC include)

# Shared library
add_library(MySharedLib SHARED src/mylib.cpp)
target_include_directories(MySharedLib PUBLIC include)

# Executable linking both
add_executable(MyApp src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(MyApp PRIVATE MyStaticLib MySharedLib)
```

#### 2. **Library Types and PIC**
**Key Points:**
- Static libraries (.a/.lib): Compiled into executable
- Shared libraries (.so/.dll): Loaded at runtime
- Position-Independent Code (PIC) required for shared libraries
- CMake automatically enables PIC for shared libs via `POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`

**Code Implementation:**
```cmake
add_library(MyShared SHARED src.cpp)
set_property(TARGET MyShared PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)
```

#### 3. **One Definition Rule (ODR)**
**Violation Example:**
```cpp
// lib1.cpp
int helper() { return 1; }

// lib2.cpp 
int helper() { return 2; } // ODR violation
```

**CMake Solution:**
```cmake
# Use anonymous namespaces
namespace {
  int helper() { return 1; } // Unique per translation unit
}
```

#### 4. **Symbol Conflicts in Dynamic Linking**
**Conflict Scenario:**
```cpp
// libA.cpp
void print() { std::cout << "A"; }

// libB.cpp
void print() { std::cout << "B"; }
```

**Resolution Strategy:**
```cpp
// Proper namespacing
namespace LibA { void print() {...} }
namespace LibB { void print() {...} }
```

#### 5. **Linking Order Matters**
**Problematic Order:**
```cmake
target_link_libraries(MyApp LibA LibB) # LibA might need symbols from LibB
```

**Correct Approach:**
```cmake
target_link_libraries(MyApp LibB LibA) # Dependencies first
```

#### 6. **Handling Unreferenced Symbols**
**CMake Solution:**
```cmake
# Force linking all symbols (GCC/Clang)
target_link_options(MyApp PRIVATE "-Wl,--no-as-needed")
```

#### 7. **Separating main() for Testing**
**Project Structure:**
```
project/
├── src/
│   ├── main.cpp
│   └── core/
├── tests/
│   └── test_main.cpp
```

**CMake Configuration:**
```cmake
# Main executable
add_executable(MainApp src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(MainApp PRIVATE CoreLib)

# Test executable
add_executable(TestRunner tests/test_main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(TestRunner PRIVATE CoreLib)
enable_testing()
add_test(NAME Tests COMMAND TestRunner)
```

#### Advanced: Interface Libraries
**Usage Example:**
```cmake
add_library(InterfaceLib INTERFACE)
target_include_directories(InterfaceLib INTERFACE include)
target_link_libraries(MainApp PRIVATE InterfaceLib)
```

#### Key CMake Practices:
1. Always use `target_link_libraries` with modern CMake syntax
2. Prefer target-based commands over global commands
3. Use `PRIVATE/PUBLIC/INTERFACE` keywords appropriately
4. Leverage `find_package` for external dependencies
5. Utilize generator expressions for conditional linking

**Complete Example (Static + Shared):**
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(LinkingDemo)

# Core library
add_library(Core STATIC src/core.cpp)
target_include_directories(Core PUBLIC include)

# Plugin system (shared)
add_library(Plugin SHARED src/plugin.cpp)
target_link_libraries(Plugin PUBLIC Core)
set_target_properties(Plugin PROPERTIES POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)

# Main executable
add_executable(MainApp src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(MainApp PRIVATE Core Plugin)

# Test executable
add_executable(TestRunner tests/test_main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(TestRunner PRIVATE Core)
add_test(NAME CoreTests COMMAND TestRunner)
```

This configuration demonstrates:
- Clear separation of components
- Proper linking order
- Mixed static/shared library usage
- Test integration
- PIC handling for shared libraries
- Modern target-based dependency management

Remember to:
- Use `$<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>` generator expressions for include paths
- Consider visibility attributes (`__declspec(dllexport)`/`visibility` defaults)
- Regularly run `cmake --build . --target help` to verify targets
- Use link-time optimization (`INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION`) where appropriate

### CMake Build Problems

---

Problem 1: Static/Shared Library Symbol Collision
**Scenario**:  
A project contains two libraries: `libutils.a` (static) and `libutils.so` (shared). Both define a global function `int calculate()`. When linking an executable that uses both libraries, the linker reports "multiple definition" errors. How would you resolve this conflict while preserving both library types?

**Solution**:
```cmake
# For the static library target:
add_library(utils_static STATIC utils.cpp)
target_compile_definitions(utils_static PRIVATE CALCULATE_IMPL=1)

# For the shared library target:
add_library(utils_shared SHARED utils.cpp)
target_compile_definitions(utils_shared PRIVATE CALCULATE_IMPL=2)
target_compile_options(utils_shared PRIVATE -fvisibility=hidden)
target_link_options(utils_shared PRIVATE -Wl,--exclude-libs=ALL)

# Executable
add_executable(app main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE utils_static utils_shared)
```

**Explanation**:
1. **Symbol Renaming**: Use preprocessor macros (`CALCULATE_IMPL`) to create distinct symbol names in each library version.
2. **Visibility Control**: Hide all symbols in the shared library by default (`-fvisibility=hidden`), then explicitly export required symbols using `__attribute__((visibility("default")))` in code.
3. **Linker Exclusion**: `--exclude-libs=ALL` prevents the shared library from re-exporting symbols from the static library.
4. **Modern CMake Practice**: Use target-specific properties to isolate compilation/linking settings per library type.

---

Problem 2: Cross-Library ODR Violation
**Scenario**:  
Two shared libraries (`libnetwork.so` and `libgraphics.so`) both include a third-party header-only math library that defines `const double PI = 3.1415`. At runtime, applications linking both libraries crash due to ODR violations. How would you resolve this using CMake?

**Solution**:
```cmake
# For both libraries:
add_library(network SHARED network.cpp)
add_library(graphics SHARED graphics.cpp)

# In source code:
namespace internal {
    constexpr double PI = 3.1415;
}

# CMake for each library:
target_compile_options(network PRIVATE -fvisibility-inlines-hidden)
target_compile_definitions(network PRIVATE MATH_NAMESPACE=internal)
target_link_options(network PRIVATE -Wl,--version-script=exports.map)

# exports.map content:
{
    global: *network_api*;
    local: *;
};
```

**Explanation**:
1. **Namespace Isolation**: Wrap the constant in a unique namespace per library using compile definitions.
2. **Symbol Visibility**: Use `-fvisibility-inlines-hidden` to hide inline symbols and version scripts to control exported symbols.
3. **Inline Variables**: For C++17+, use `inline constexpr` to avoid ODR issues with constants.
4. **CMake Integration**: Combine compile options, definitions, and linker scripts to enforce symbol visibility boundaries.

---

Problem 3: Circular Dependency Resolution
**Scenario**:  
Three libraries (`A`, `B`, `C`) have circular dependencies: A depends on B, B depends on C, and C depends on A. The linker fails with "undefined reference" errors. How would you resolve this using modern CMake?

**Solution**:
```cmake
# Library A
add_library(A OBJECT a.cpp)
target_include_directories(A PUBLIC include)

# Library B
add_library(B OBJECT b.cpp)
target_include_directories(B PUBLIC include)

# Library C
add_library(C OBJECT c.cpp)
target_include_directories(C PUBLIC include)

# Combine into interface library
add_library(combined INTERFACE)
target_link_libraries(combined INTERFACE 
    $<TARGET_OBJECTS:A>
    $<TARGET_OBJECTS:B>
    $<TARGET_OBJECTS:C>
)

# Final executable
add_executable(main main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE combined)
```

**Explanation**:
1. **Object Libraries**: Use `OBJECT` libraries to delay linking until all dependencies are resolved.
2. **Interface Aggregation**: Create an INTERFACE library to collect all object files simultaneously.
3. **CMake Generator Expressions**: Use `$<TARGET_OBJECTS>` to handle object file dependencies.
4. **Dependency Ordering**: The combined approach lets the linker see all objects at once, resolving circular references through deferred linking.
