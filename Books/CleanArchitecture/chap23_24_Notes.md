### Chapter 23: Presenters and Humble Objects

**Key Concepts**
1. **Humble Object Pattern**:
   - Separates logic that is hard to test (e.g., UI, I/O) from business logic.
   - Core idea: Move testable logic into "humble" components with minimal behavior.

2. **Presenter**:
   - Acts as an intermediary between business logic and UI.
   - Converts business data into a format suitable for display (e.g., HTML, JSON).
   - Ensures UI remains "humble" (no business logic).

---

**Code Example: Presenter + View**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Model (Business Data)
struct Order {
    std::string id;
    double amount;
};

// View Interface (Humble Object)
class OrderView {
public:
    virtual void display(const std::string& formattedData) = 0;
    virtual ~OrderView() = default;
};

// Presenter (Converts Model to View-friendly format)
class OrderPresenter {
public:
    explicit OrderPresenter(OrderView& view) : view(view) {}

    void present(const Order& order) {
        std::string formatted = "Order ID: " + order.id + ", Amount: $" + std::to_string(order.amount);
        view.display(formatted);
    }

private:
    OrderView& view;
};

// Concrete View Implementation (Console)
class ConsoleOrderView : public OrderView {
public:
    void display(const std::string& formattedData) override {
        std::cout << "Displaying Order: " << formattedData << std::endl;
    }
};

// Test Case
int main() {
    ConsoleOrderView view;
    OrderPresenter presenter(view);
    Order order{"12345", 99.99};
    presenter.present(order);  // Output: "Displaying Order: Order ID: 12345, Amount: $99.99"
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**
- **Humble Object**: `ConsoleOrderView` has no business logic; it only displays formatted data.
- **Presenter**: `OrderPresenter` converts `Order` to a string and delegates display to the view.
- **Testability**: Business logic (formatting) is tested via `OrderPresenter`, while `ConsoleOrderView` is trivially simple.

### Chapter 24: Partial Boundaries

**Key Concepts**
1. **Partial Boundaries**:
   - Trade-off between full architectural boundaries (costly) and no boundaries (inflexible).
   - Strategies:
     - **Skipping the Last Step**: Define interfaces but defer full implementation.
     - **Facades**: Create simplified interfaces to subsystems.

2. **Use Cases**:
   - Early project phases where full boundaries are premature.
   - Integrating third-party systems incrementally.

---

**Code Example: Facade Pattern (Partial Boundary)**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

// Subsystem: Payment Processing
class PaymentProcessor {
public:
    virtual void processPayment(double amount) = 0;
    virtual ~PaymentProcessor() = default;
};

// Partial Boundary: Facade for Payment + Logistics (incomplete)
class OrderFacade {
public:
    explicit OrderFacade(std::unique_ptr<PaymentProcessor> processor)
        : paymentProcessor(std::move(processor)) {}

    void executeOrder(double amount) {
        paymentProcessor->processPayment(amount);
        // Logistics not yet implemented (partial boundary)
        std::cout << "Logistics pending..." << std::endl;
    }

private:
    std::unique_ptr<PaymentProcessor> paymentProcessor;
};

// Concrete Payment Processor
class PayPalProcessor : public PaymentProcessor {
public:
    void processPayment(double amount) override {
        std::cout << "Processing $" << amount << " via PayPal." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Test Case
int main() {
    auto processor = std::make_unique<PayPalProcessor>();
    OrderFacade facade(std::move(processor));
    facade.executeOrder(150.0);  // Output: "Processing $150 via PayPal. Logistics pending..."
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**
- **Partial Boundary**: `OrderFacade` integrates payment processing but defers logistics (a placeholder).
- **Flexibility**: Allows incremental development without full upfront costs.
- **Testability**: Payment logic is testable; logistics can be mocked/stubbed.

---

**Testing & Compilation**
1. **Compilation**:
   - Use `g++ -std=c++17 -o example example.cpp` (adjust filenames as needed).
2. **Test Outputs**:
   - **Chapter 23**: Validates formatted string generation and display.
   - **Chapter 24**: Confirms payment processing works while logistics are pending.

**Summary**
- **Chapter 23**: Decouple UI from business logic using Presenters; keep views "humble."
- **Chapter 24**: Use facades or deferred implementations to manage complexity in evolving systems.

### Compilable Test Code Examples

1. Humble Object (Java)
```java
interface DataExporter {
    String export(String data);
}

class CSVExporter implements DataExporter {
    public String export(String data) {
        return "CSV: " + data; // Simple formatting
    }
}

class ReportGenerator {
    private DataExporter exporter;
    public ReportGenerator(DataExporter exporter) {
        this.exporter = exporter;
    }
    public String generateReport(String rawData) {
        return exporter.export(rawData.toUpperCase());
    }
}
```

2. Facade Pattern (Python)
```python
class InventoryService:
    def check_stock(self, product_id):
        return 100  # Simulated stock check

class OrderFacade:
    def __init__(self):
        self.inventory = InventoryService()
    
    def place_order(self, product_id, quantity):
        if self.inventory.check_stock(product_id) >= quantity:
            return "Order placed"
        else:
            return "Insufficient stock"
```

3. Partial Boundary with Interface (C#)
```csharp
public interface IShippingService {
    void Ship(Order order);
}

public class FedExShipping : IShippingService {
    public void Ship(Order order) {
        Console.WriteLine($"Shipping via FedEx: {order.Id}");
    }
}

public class OrderProcessor {
    private IShippingService shipper;
    public OrderProcessor(IShippingService shipper) {
        this.shipper = shipper;
    }
    public void Process(Order order) {
        shipper.Ship(order);
    }
}
```
