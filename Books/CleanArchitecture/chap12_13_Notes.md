### Step-by-Step Guide to Chapters 12 & 13 of *Clean Architecture*

### **Chapter 12: Components**
**Key Concepts**
1. **Definition of a Component**:  
   A component is a deployable unit of software that encapsulates functionality (e.g., a `.jar`, `.dll`, or `.gem` file). Components are the smallest entities that can be versioned and released independently.

2. **Relocatability**:  
   Components should be designed for flexibility in deployment. For example, a component should not hardcode assumptions about its runtime environment (e.g., file paths, network configurations).

3. **Linkers and Dependencies**:  
   Linkers resolve dependencies between components at compile/load time. Well-designed components minimize unnecessary dependencies.

---

**Code Example: Component Boundaries**  
**Scenario**: A payment processing system with two components:  
- `PaymentProcessor` (business logic)  
- `PaymentGateway` (third-party API integration).

```java
// PaymentGateway.java (Component 1)
public interface PaymentGateway {
    boolean processPayment(double amount);
}

// PayPalGateway.java (Implements PaymentGateway)
public class PayPalGateway implements PaymentGateway {
    @Override
    public boolean processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing $" + amount + " via PayPal...");
        return true; // Simplified for example
    }
}

// PaymentProcessor.java (Component 2)
public class PaymentProcessor {
    private final PaymentGateway gateway;
    
    public PaymentProcessor(PaymentGateway gateway) {
        this.gateway = gateway;
    }
    
    public void executePayment(double amount) {
        if (gateway.processPayment(amount)) {
            System.out.println("Payment succeeded!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Payment failed.");
        }
    }
}

// Main.java (Test)
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentGateway paypal = new PayPalGateway();
        PaymentProcessor processor = new PaymentProcessor(paypal);
        processor.executePayment(100.0);
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
Processing $100.0 via PayPal...
Payment succeeded!
```

**Explanation**:  
- `PaymentGateway` is an interface to decouple the payment processor from specific gateway implementations.  
- `PaymentProcessor` depends on the abstraction (`PaymentGateway`), not concrete classes.  
- Components can be swapped (e.g., replace `PayPalGateway` with `StripeGateway`) without modifying `PaymentProcessor`.

### **Chapter 13: Component Cohesion**
**Key Principles**
1. **Reuse/Release Equivalence Principle (REP)**:  
   Classes grouped into a component should be reusable together. If you reuse one class, you should need all others in the component.

2. **Common Closure Principle (CCP)**:  
   Classes that change together (for the same reason) belong in the same component. Reduces the impact of changes.

3. **Common Reuse Principle (CRP)**:  
   Classes used together should be in the same component. Avoid forcing users to depend on unused classes.

---

#### **Code Example: Applying Cohesion Principles**  
**Scenario**: A reporting system with three components:  
- `ReportGenerator` (REP/CCP)  
- `PDFFormatter` (CCP/CRP)  
- `CSVFormatter` (CCP/CRP).

```java
// ReportGenerator.java (REP/CCP)
public class ReportGenerator {
    private final DataFetcher fetcher;
    
    public ReportGenerator(DataFetcher fetcher) {
        this.fetcher = fetcher;
    }
    
    public String generateReport() {
        String data = fetcher.fetchData();
        return "Report: " + data;
    }
}

// DataFetcher.java (Abstraction for CCP)
public interface DataFetcher {
    String fetchData();
}

// DatabaseFetcher.java (CCP)
public class DatabaseFetcher implements DataFetcher {
    @Override
    public String fetchData() {
        return "Data from database";
    }
}

// PDFFormatter.java (CRP)
public class PDFFormatter {
    public String format(String report) {
        return "PDF: " + report;
    }
}

// CSVFormatter.java (CRP)
public class CSVFormatter {
    public String format(String report) {
        return "CSV: " + report;
    }
}

// Main.java (Test)
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DataFetcher fetcher = new DatabaseFetcher();
        ReportGenerator generator = new ReportGenerator(fetcher);
        String report = generator.generateReport();
        
        PDFFormatter pdfFormatter = new PDFFormatter();
        System.out.println(pdfFormatter.format(report));
        
        CSVFormatter csvFormatter = new CSVFormatter();
        System.out.println(csvFormatter.format(report));
    }
}
```

**Output**:  
```
PDF: Report: Data from database  
CSV: Report: Data from database  
```

**Explanation**:  
- **REP**: `ReportGenerator` and `DataFetcher` are grouped because they are reused together.  
- **CCP**: `DatabaseFetcher` changes only if data-fetching logic changes.  
- **CRP**: `PDFFormatter` and `CSVFormatter` are separate components since they’re used independently.

**Key Takeaways**
1. **Component Design**:  
   - Use interfaces to decouple components.  
   - Design for relocatability (avoid hardcoding environment specifics).  

2. **Cohesion Principles**:  
   - Group classes by **why they change** (CCP), **how they’re reused** (REP), and **how they’re used together** (CRP).  

3. **Testing**:  
   - Always validate component interactions with `main` methods or unit tests.  
   - Ensure components can be swapped without breaking the system.

#include <iostream>
#include "MathComponent.h"

int main() {
    Calculator calc;
    std::cout << "Calculator: " << calc.add(2, 3) << std::endl;
    // GeometryUtils unused but still linked.
    return 0;
}
```  
**Compilation:** Ensure `MathComponent.h` contains both classes. The code compiles but violates CRP/CCP.
