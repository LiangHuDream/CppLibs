### Step-by-Step Guide to Chapter 1: Key Concepts and Code Examples

---

#### 1.1 Information is Bits + Context
**Key Concepts**:
- All digital information (programs, data, files) is stored as sequences of **bits** (0s and 1s).
- The same sequence of bits can represent different data types (integers, text, machine instructions) depending on **context**.
- **ASCII** encoding maps text characters to 8-bit values. Example: `35` (hex `0x23`) = `#`, `10` (hex `0x0A`) = newline (`\n`).

**Code Example**:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Character: %c\n", 0x41); // 0x41 = 'A' in ASCII
    return 0;
}
```
**Compilation**:
```bash
gcc -o ascii_example ascii_example.c
./ascii_example
```
**Output**:
```
Character: A
```

#### 1.2 Programs Are Translated by Other Programs
**Key Concepts**:
- **Compilation System Stages**:
  1. **Preprocessing**: Expands `#include` directives, macros.
  2. **Compilation**: Translates C to assembly.
  3. **Assembly**: Converts assembly to machine code (object file).
  4. **Linking**: Combines object files into an executable.

**Example Workflow**:
1. **Source File**: `hello.c`
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   int main() {
       printf("Hello, World\n");
       return 0;
   }
   ```
2. **Preprocessing**:
   ```bash
   gcc -E hello.c -o hello.i  # Output: hello.i (expanded source)
   ```
3. **Compilation to Assembly**:
   ```bash
   gcc -S hello.i -o hello.s  # Output: hello.s (assembly code)
   ```
4. **Assembly to Object File**:
   ```bash
   gcc -c hello.s -o hello.o  # Output: hello.o (machine code)
   ```
5. **Linking**:
   ```bash
   gcc hello.o -o hello       # Output: executable 'hello'
   ```

#### 1.4 Processors Read and Interpret Instructions
**Key Concepts**:
- **CPU Execution Cycle**:
  1. **Fetch**: Read instruction from memory.
  2. **Decode**: Interpret instruction.
  3. **Execute**: Perform operation.
  4. **Repeat**.

**Hardware Components**:
- **CPU**: Executes instructions.
- **Main Memory**: Stores programs/data during execution.
- **I/O Devices**: Handle input/output (e.g., disk, display).

**Assembly Example** (from `hello.s`):
```assembly
main:
    subq    $8, %rsp
    movl    $.LC0, %edi   # .LC0 = "Hello, World\n"
    call    puts
    movl    $0, %eax
    addq    $8, %rsp
    ret
```

#### 1.5 Caches Matter
**Key Concepts**:
- **Memory Hierarchy**: Registers → L1/L2/L3 Cache → Main Memory → Disk.
- **Temporal Locality**: Recently accessed data is likely to be reused.
- **Spatial Locality**: Data near accessed items is likely to be used.

**Code Example** (Cache-Friendly vs. Unfriendly):
```c
// Cache-friendly (row-major access)
void sum_rows(int arr[1000][1000]) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < 1000; j++)
            sum += arr[i][j];
}

// Cache-unfriendly (column-major access)
void sum_cols(int arr[1000][1000]) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 1000; j++)
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
            sum += arr[i][j];
}
```
**Performance Tip**:
- Row-major access exploits **spatial locality** (adjacent elements stored contiguously).

#### 1.7 Operating System Manages Hardware
**Key Concepts**:
- **Processes**: Isolation between running programs.
- **Virtual Memory**: Each process sees private address space.
- **Files**: Uniform abstraction for I/O devices.

**Code Example** (Creating a Process with `fork()`):
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child Process\n");
    } else {
        printf("Parent Process\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
**Compilation**:
```bash
gcc -o fork_example fork_example.c
./fork_example
```
**Output**:
```
Parent Process
Child Process
```

#### 1.8 Network Communication
**Key Concepts**:
- **Client-Server Model**: Programs communicate over networks via sockets.
- **IP Addresses**: Identify hosts (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
- **Ports**: Identify services (e.g., port 80 for HTTP).

**Code Example** (Simple TCP Client):
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>

int main() {
    int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    struct sockaddr_in server_addr = {
        .sin_family = AF_INET,
        .sin_port = htons(80),      // HTTP port
        .sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("93.184.216.34") // example.com
    };
    connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr));
    printf("Connected to server\n");
    return 0;
}
```
**Compilation**:
```bash
gcc -o tcp_client tcp_client.c
./tcp_client
```

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Bits + Context**: Understand how binary representations map to data types.
2. **Compilation Stages**: Use `gcc -E`, `-S`, `-c` to inspect intermediate outputs.
3. **Memory Hierarchy**: Optimize code for cache locality (e.g., row-major access).
4. **OS Abstractions**: Use processes, virtual memory, and files in programs.
5. **Networking**: Build client/server apps with sockets.
