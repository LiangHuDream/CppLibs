### Chapter 7: Linking - Key Concepts & Code Walkthrough

---

#### 1. Static Linking Process
**Key Concepts**:
- Combines multiple relocatable object files into a single executable
- Two main tasks: **Symbol Resolution** (linking references to definitions) and **Relocation** (adjusting code/data addresses)

**Code Example**:  
File `main.c`:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

extern int global_var;  // External symbol declaration
extern void foo();      // External function declaration

int main() {
    printf("global_var = %d\n", global_var);
    foo();
    return 0;
}
```

File `module.c`:
```c
int global_var = 42;  // Symbol definition

void foo() {
    printf("Hello from foo!\n");
}
```

**Compilation**:
```bash
gcc -c main.c -o main.o
gcc -c module.c -o module.o
gcc main.o module.o -o final_executable
```

**Output**:
```
global_var = 42
Hello from foo!
```

---

#### 2. Symbol Resolution & Strong/Weak Symbols
**Key Concepts**:
- **Strong Symbols**: Functions/initialized global variables
- **Weak Symbols**: Uninitialized global variables
- Linker chooses strong symbols over weak ones

**Conflict Example** (Error Case):  
File `a.c`:
```c
int x = 10;  // Strong symbol
```

File `b.c`:
```c
int x = 20;  // Another strong symbol -> Linker Error
```

**Correct Version**:  
File `a.c`:
```c
int x = 10;  // Strong symbol
```

File `b.c`:
```c
extern int x;  // Proper declaration
void print_x() {
    printf("%d\n", x);
}
```

---

#### 3. Static Libraries (.a files)
**Key Concepts**:
- Archive of relocatable object files
- Resolved at link time

**Implementation**:  
1. Create library:  
File `mylib.c`:
```c
int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
int mult(int a, int b) { return a * b; }
```

File `main.c`:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int, int);  // Declaration
int mult(int, int);

int main() {
    printf("3+4=%d\n", add(3,4));
    printf("3*4=%d\n", mult(3,4));
    return 0;
}
```

**Commands**:
```bash
gcc -c mylib.c -o mylib.o
ar rcs libmylib.a mylib.o
gcc main.c -L. -lmylib -o static_demo
```

**Output**:
```
3+4=7
3*4=12
```

---

#### 4. Dynamic Linking with Shared Libraries (.so)
**Key Concepts**:
- Loaded at runtime
- Position-Independent Code (PIC) required
- Smaller executable size, memory sharing

**Implementation**:  
File `shlib.c`:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void shared_func() {
    printf("From shared library!\n");
}
```

**Commands**:
```bash
gcc -fPIC -c shlib.c -o shlib.o
gcc -shared shlib.o -o libshlib.so
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH  # For runtime
```

File `main.c`:
```c
int main() {
    extern void shared_func();
    shared_func();
    return 0;
}
```

**Compile & Run**:
```bash
gcc main.c -L. -lshlib -o dynamic_demo
./dynamic_demo
```

**Output**:
```
From shared library!
```

---

#### 5. Position-Independent Code (PIC)
**Key Concepts**:
- Uses GOT (Global Offset Table) for external references
- Enables shared library code to load at any address

**Inspection Command**:
```bash
objdump -d -j .plt libshlib.so  # View PLT entries
```

---

#### 6. Library Interposition
**Three Methods**:
1. **Compile-Time**: Use macros
2. **Link-Time**: Use `--wrap` flag
3. **Runtime**: `LD_PRELOAD`

**Runtime Interposition Example**:  
File `mymalloc.c`:
```c
#include <dlfcn.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void *malloc(size_t size) {
    static void *(*real_malloc)(size_t) = NULL;
    if (!real_malloc)
        real_malloc = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "malloc");
    
    void *p = real_malloc(size);
    printf("Allocated %zu bytes at %p\n", size, p);
    return p;
}
```

**Compile & Test**:
```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -ldl mymalloc.c -o mymalloc.so
LD_PRELOAD=./mymalloc.so ./any_program_using_malloc
```

---

#### Testing & Verification
**Useful Tools**:
```bash
readelf -s main.o        # View symbol table
nm --dynamic executable  # Show dynamic symbols
ldd executable           # List shared library dependencies
objdump -d main.o        # Disassemble object file
```

### **Answers and Explanations**

---

**Question 1**  
**Correct Answers:** A, C  
- **A**: Strong symbols (e.g., functions) override weak symbols (e.g., uninitialized globals).  
- **C**: If two strong symbols conflict, the linker issues an error. Weak symbols with different types are allowed.  
- **B**: Incorrect. Multiple weak symbols do not cause errors; the linker picks one arbitrarily.  
- **D**: Incorrect. Weak symbols are resolved by size only if they are uninitialized globals (not "largest").  

**Question 2**  
**Correct Answers:** B, C  
- **B/C**: Relocation resolves absolute/PC-relative addresses using relocation entries.  
- **A**: Merging sections occurs earlier (during "section merging").  
- **D**: GOT is for dynamic linking, not static relocation.  

**Question 3**  
**Correct Answers:** A, B  
- **A**: Static libraries are linked at compile time.  
- **B**: Dynamic libraries save memory via shared pages.  
- **C**: Incorrect. Static linking often produces larger executables.  
- **D**: Incorrect. Dynamic libraries load only necessary parts.  

**Question 4**  
**Correct Answers:** A, D  
- **A/D**: Linkers merge sections and use scripts for custom layouts.  
- **B**: ASLR is handled by the loader, not the linker.

**Question 5**  
**Correct Answers:** A, C  
- **A/C**: PIC uses GOT for globals and PC-relative addressing.  
- **B**: PLT handles function calls, not variables.  
- **D**: `-fno-pic` disables PIC, making code non-relocatable.  

**Question 6**  
**Correct Answers:** B, C  
- **B**: `LD_PRELOAD` injects libraries at runtime.  
- **C**: `--wrap` allows function wrapping.

**Question 7**  
**Correct Answers:** A, B  
- **A/B**: GOT is runtime-modified; PLT enables lazy binding.  
- **C**: GOT handles both data and function addresses.  
- **D**: PLT resolution occurs at runtime.  

**Question 8**  
**Correct Answers:** A, B, C, D  
- All are valid ELF sections. `.debug` is optional.

- **D**: `#include` is for compile-time headers, not libraries.  

**Question 15**  
**Correct Answers:** A, B, C
