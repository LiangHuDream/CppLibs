### Chapter 9: Consistency and Consensus 

---

#### 1. Consistency Guarantees
**Key Idea**:  
Systems must define what consistency means in their context, balancing between strict guarantees and practical performance.

- **Eventual Consistency**:
  - *Definition*: All replicas eventually converge to the same state if no new writes occur.
  - *Use Case*: Suitable for high availability (e.g., DNS, social media feeds).
  - *Trade-off*: Temporary inconsistencies may occur ("read your own writes" problem).

- **Linearizability**:
  - *Definition*: A *strong consistency* model where operations appear atomic and ordered in real time.
  - *Requirements*:  
    - All reads reflect the most recent write.  
    - No operation can observe intermediate states.
  - *Challenges*:  
    - High latency due to coordination.  
    - Conflicts with availability during network partitions (CAP theorem).

---

#### 2. Linearizability (Strong Consistency)
**Core Mechanics**:
- **Real-Time Order**: Operations have a global timeline. If operation A completes before B starts, B sees A's effects.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Lock services (e.g., ZooKeeper).  
  - Leader election in consensus protocols.
- **Implementation**:
  - Synchronous replication (e.g., primary-replica systems with quorum writes).  
  - Requires atomic broadcast or consensus protocols (e.g., Raft, Paxos).

**Trade-offs**:
- **Performance**: High latency due to coordination.  
- **Availability**: Violates CAP theorem during partitions (CP systems).  
- **Complexity**: Hard to scale in geographically distributed systems.

---

#### 3. Ordering Guarantees
**Why Order Matters**:
- Causality preservation (e.g., replying to a message after it was sent).  
- Replica synchronization (e.g., log replication in databases).

- **Total Order**:
  - All nodes agree on the exact sequence of operations.  
  - Required for linearizability.  
  - Example: Primary node serializing writes in a single-leader replication system.

- **Partial Order**:
  - Operations may not have a global sequence.  
  - Used in conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs).  
  - Example: Version vectors in Dynamo-style systems.

---

#### 4. Distributed Transactions and Consensus
**Atomic Commit & 2PC**:
- **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**:
  - *Phase 1*: Coordinator asks all participants to prepare.  
  - *Phase 2*: Commit or abort based on participants' votes.  
  - *Weaknesses*:  
    - Coordinator failure can block transactions indefinitely.  
    - Not partition-tolerant (violates CAP).

**Fault-Tolerant Consensus**:
- **Paxos**:
  - Uses quorums and proposals to agree on values.  
  - Complex to implement but widely studied.  
  - Optimized for "safety over liveness."

- **Raft**:
  - Leader-based protocol with log replication.  
  - Easier to understand than Paxos.  
  - Used in etcd, Consul, and Kubernetes.

- **Zab**:
  - Used in ZooKeeper.  
  - Combines leader election with atomic broadcast.

**FLP Impossibility**:
- In asynchronous networks, no consensus algorithm can guarantee termination (liveness) under all failure scenarios.  
- Workarounds: Timeouts and practical assumptions about network reliability.

---

#### 5. Consensus in Practice
**Applications**:
- **Leader Election**: Ensuring only one node acts as leader (e.g., Raft).  
- **Atomic Broadcast**: Replicating logs consistently (e.g., Kafka with ISR).  
- **Distributed Locks**: Linearizable locks for coordination (e.g., ZooKeeper).

**Challenges**:
- **Byzantine Faults**:
  - Nodes may act maliciously (rarely handled in classic consensus protocols).  
  - Requires BFT protocols (e.g., PBFT), common in blockchain systems.  
- **Performance Overhead**:  
  - Quorum writes increase latency.  
  - Trade-off between consistency and throughput.

---

#### 6. CAP Theorem Revisited
**Key Takeaways**:
- In a partition (network failure), systems choose between:  
  - **Consistency (CP)**: Reject requests to maintain linearizability (e.g., ZooKeeper).  
  - **Availability (AP)**: Serve stale data but remain responsive (e.g., Dynamo, Cassandra).  
- **No "CA" System**: All distributed systems must handle partitions, making pure CA impossible.

---

#### 7. Case Studies
- **Spanner (Google)**:  
  Uses TrueTime API for linearizability across global datacenters. Combates clock skew with synchronized atomic clocks.  
- **Cassandra**:  
  AP system with tunable consistency (quorum writes for stronger guarantees).  
- **Kafka**:  
  Achieves atomic broadcast via ISR (in-sync replicas) and leader-follower replication.

---

### Summary of Challenges
1. **Linearizability vs. Availability**: Strong consistency limits scalability and partition tolerance.  
2. **Consensus Overhead**: Protocols like Raft add latency but ensure safety.  
3. **Partial Failures**: Handling network delays and node crashes requires careful trade-offs.  
4. **Clock Synchronization**: Critical for time-based consistency (e.g., Spanner’s TrueTime).  

### Practical Takeaways
- Use linearizability sparingly (e.g., for critical metadata).  
- Prefer eventual consistency for high-throughput systems.  
- Leverage consensus protocols (Raft, Paxos) for fault-tolerant coordination.  
- Always design for partition tolerance (embrace CAP constraints).

---

**Question 2**  
**Correct Answers**: A, C  
- **A**: True. Causal consistency preserves causal dependencies (e.g., reply-after-post).  
- **C**: True. Concurrent operations (no causal link) can be reordered.
