### Chapter 3: Storage and Retrieval

#### 1. Data Structures Powering Databases
**Core Idea**: Databases rely on efficient data structures to store and retrieve data.  
- **Hash Indexes**:  
  - **Structure**: Simple in-memory hash tables mapping keys to byte offsets in a data file.  
  - **Use Case**: Good for key-value stores with frequent appends (e.g., Bitcask).  
  - **Limitations**:  
    - Poor performance for range queries.  
    - Memory constraints (entire index must fit in RAM).  
    - Not durable unless backed by write-ahead logs (WAL).  

- **SSTables and LSM-Trees**:  
  - **SSTable (Sorted String Table)**:  
    - Key-value pairs sorted by key and grouped into immutable files.  
    - Merged in the background via compaction to remove duplicates.  
  - **LSM-Tree (Log-Structured Merge-Tree)**:  
    - Combines in-memory memtables (sorted) and on-disk SSTables.  
    - Writes are fast (sequential appends), reads may require checking multiple SSTables.  
    - **Trade-offs**:  
      - Write-optimized (high throughput).  
      - Reads can be slower (require merging from multiple SSTables).  
      - Background compaction impacts I/O and CPU.  

- **B-Trees**:  
  - **Structure**:  
    - Fixed-size blocks/pages (e.g., 4 KB), organized as a balanced tree.  
    - Pages contain keys and pointers to child pages or data.  
  - **Operations**:  
    - Writes require splitting/merging pages to maintain balance (overhead).  
    - Reads are efficient (logarithmic time).  
  - **Trade-offs vs. LSM-Trees**:  
    - Slower writes (due to page splits and write amplification).  
    - Faster reads (no need to check multiple files).  
    - Fragmentation and recovery complexity (WAL required for crash safety).

#### 2. Indexing Structures
- **Clustered vs. Non-Clustered Indexes**:  
  - **Clustered**: Data stored in index order (e.g., primary key in B-Tree).  
  - **Non-Clustered**: Separate index structure pointing to data location (e.g., secondary indexes).  
- **Multi-Column Indexes**:  
  - Concatenated indexes (e.g., (last_name, first_name)) for composite queries.  
  - Limited flexibility for non-prefix queries.  
- **Full-Text Search Indexes**:  
  - Inverted indexes mapping words to document IDs (e.g., Elasticsearch).  

---

#### 3. Transactional Processing vs. Analytics
- **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**:  
  - **Characteristics**:  
    - High volume of small, fast reads/writes.  
    - Queries operate on small subsets of data (e.g., user lookup by ID).  
  - **Storage**: Row-oriented (optimized for retrieving entire records).  

- **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**:  
  - **Characteristics**:  
    - Complex analytical queries over large datasets (e.g., aggregation, JOINs).  
    - Batch-oriented, read-heavy workloads.  
  - **Storage**: Column-oriented (optimized for scanning specific columns).  

---

#### 4. Data Warehousing and Columnar Storage
- **Data Warehouse**:  
  - Centralized repository for OLAP workloads.  
  - **Star/Snowflake Schemas**:  
    - **Star Schema**: Fact table (metrics) linked to dimension tables (descriptive attributes).  
    - **Snowflake Schema**: Normalized dimensions (reduces redundancy).  

- **Column-Oriented Storage**:  
  - **Structure**: Data stored column-wise (e.g., Parquet, Cassandraâ€™s SASI).  
  - **Advantages**:  
    - Compression efficiency (similar data types in a column).  
      - Techniques: Bitmap encoding, run-length encoding, dictionary encoding.  
    - Vectorized processing (batch operations on column chunks).  
  - **Challenges**:  
    - Slow writes (columns must be updated across multiple files).  
    - Requires sorting and materialized views for query optimization.  

---

#### 5. Key Challenges and Trade-offs
- **Write Amplification**:  
  - **LSM-Trees**: High write throughput but requires compaction.  
  - **B-Trees**: Write amplification due to page splits and WAL.  
- **Read/Write Optimization**:  
  - LSM-Trees favor writes; B-Trees favor reads.  
- **Compression in Column Stores**:  
  - Benefits storage and I/O but complicates updates.  
- **Sort Order**:  
  - Clustered indexes (B-Tree) vs. SSTable sorting (LSM-Tree).  
  - Columnar storage often sorts rows to group similar values for compression.  

---

#### 6. Real-World Implications
- **Choosing Between LSM and B-Tree**:  
  - **LSM**: Use for write-heavy workloads (e.g., logging, time-series data).  
  - **B-Tree**: Use for read-heavy, transactional systems (e.g., relational databases).  
- **Hybrid Approaches**:  
  - Some systems (e.g., CockroachDB) combine LSM and B-Tree features.  
- **Columnar Storage in Analytics**:  
  - Tools like Apache Parquet and Google BigQuery leverage columnar storage for fast aggregation.  

---

### Summary of Key Takeaways
1. **Storage Engines**:  
   - LSM-Trees excel in write-heavy scenarios but require compaction.  
   - B-Trees offer faster reads but suffer from write amplification.  
2. **OLTP vs. OLAP**:  
   - Row vs. column storage depends on workload (transactional vs. analytical).  
3. **Columnar Optimization**:  
   - Enables compression and efficient analytics but complicates writes.  
4. **Indexing**:  
   - Secondary indexes and specialized structures (e.g., inverted indexes) expand query capabilities at a storage cost.
